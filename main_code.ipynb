      "Mr. Anil Kumar K from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and one of the core team members of Chandrayaan-3 mission. He is the \"Deputy Project Director\" for VIKRAM Lander and has led the propulsion team of more than 80 scientists for this mission for the last 5 years. The propulsion system of VIKRAM Lander played a crucial role on the day of landing (23rd August 2023) by providing necessary braking force throughout the descent phase. This helped in achieving soft and precise landing near the lunar south pole for the first time in history. He was honoured with the prestigious \"ISRO Young scientist of the year\" award in 2016 for his outstanding contribution to Chandrayaan VIKRAM Lander programme. He was deputed thrice to \"European space agency\" by ISRO and played a crucial role in the successful launch of ISRO's communication satellites GSAT-18 and GSAT-24 from European spaceport, French Guiana.\n",

Consequently, any negative attendance adjustments will be reflected in ERP.\n",

This undertaking should also state that the student takes full responsibility for any attendance discrepancies following the application of medical leave.\n",

About the Guest:Mr. Anil Kumar K from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and one of the core team members of Chandrayaan-3 mission. He is the \"Deputy Project Director\" for VIKRAM Lander and has led the propulsion team of more than 80 scientists for this mission for the last 5 years. The propulsion system of VIKRAM Lander played a crucial role on the day of landing (23rd August 2023) by providing necessary braking force throughout the descent phase. This helped in achieving soft and precise landing near the lunar south pole for the first time in history. He was honoured with the prestigious \"ISRO Young scientist of the year\" award in 2016 for his outstanding contribution to Chandrayaan VIKRAM Lander programme. He was deputed thrice to \"European space agency\" by ISRO and played a crucial role in the successful launch of ISRO\\'s communication satellites GSAT-18 and GSAT-24 from European spaceport, French Guiana.Regards,HOD-CSE', 'Shivani Tyagi Mam: Dear HODsInspite of repeated instructions passed on to all HODs, all mentors and all students, it is very sad to see a very large number of second, third and fourth year students reaching to exam floor by 9:55am or 10:00amStudents can’t be allowed to exam halls without frisking and therefore they are further delayed.These late comers create disturbance in the quite atmosphere of the exam hall where invigilators are busy in distributing question papers to the students and students seated in time are busy in doing various entries in answer sheets or solving the MCQs.These late comers are deprived of the last minute instructions given by the invigilators and are likely to be caught for malpractice.Because of these reasons the instructions given at the back of hall ticket mentioned the reporting time as 9:30am*HODs are supposed to ensure that through CLass Mentors this information reaches each and every student that the entry to exam halls will be stopped by 9:40am / 1:40pm and latecomers will then be allowed by 10:25am/ 2:25pm.This entry will be possible after receiving an apology letter signed by their HODs*All the  concerned HODs are requested to be present at the entry point ( in front of the lift ) by 9:15 am for FN session and 1:15 pm for AN session.Your cooperation in this regard is highly required.In anticipation Thanks and regards', 'Shivani Tyagi Mam: Regarding - Guest Lecture on Challenges in Lunar Landing on November 28, 2023( from 2.00 PM to 4.00 PM)Dear Team CSE,It is a matter of pride that the CSE department is hosting a Guest Lecture on Challenges in Lunar Landing on November 28, 2023 from 2.00 PM to 4.00 PM by Mr. Anil Kumar K, Deputy Project Director (Propulsion system), VIKRAM Lander, Chandrayaan 3 Mission, Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Trivandrum, Kerala.

Kindly go through the following points mentioned below.1.  If a student has not yet filled out the elective course selection form, kindly remind them that now subjects will be allocated by department (Already informed earlier).2.  Furthermore, it has come to our attention that some elective courses currently chosen by students are less than the criteria to run that subject so we  make adjustments based on departmental allocations (Already informed earlier). Due to the lower-than-expected registration in certain subjects, we may have to explore alternative arrangements for these courses.3. We kindly urge you to communicate with your students, especially those who have selected elective courses with low registration numbers.4. Kindly find the list attached in this mail of your section, verify the list that all students are of your section or not and give the details of those students whose name is not in the list or any extra student.5. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated, and it will contribute to a smoother elective course allocation process.6.
